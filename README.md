# NeuroLearn 🧠📘

## Project Overview
NeuroLearn is an inclusive digital learning platform designed specifically for neurodivergent students, including learners with ADHD, autism, and dyslexia. The platform adapts to individual cognitive styles, sensory preferences, and learning speeds to create a supportive, engaging, and accessible educational experience.

Unlike traditional learning platforms that follow a one-size-fits-all approach, NeuroLearn focuses on personalized learning journeys. It combines structured workflows, multimodal content delivery, and sensory-friendly design to help students learn effectively without cognitive overload.

## Problem Statement
Most existing e-learning platforms are designed for neurotypical learners and assume sustained attention, strong reading skills, and tolerance for dense or visually stimulating interfaces. As a result, neurodivergent students face several challenges:

- Students with ADHD struggle with focus, task completion, and long lessons.
- Autistic learners experience sensory overload, anxiety due to unpredictability, and difficulty navigating complex interfaces.
- Dyslexic learners face barriers due to text-heavy content, unsuitable fonts, and lack of audio-visual support.

These limitations lead to disengagement, frustration, and reduced learning outcomes. There is a clear need for a learning platform that is intentionally designed to accommodate neurodiverse learning needs through personalization, accessibility, and adaptive support.

## Target Users
NeuroLearn is designed for:

- **Neurodivergent students (ages 8–18)**  
  Students diagnosed with ADHD, autism, or dyslexia who need adaptive, accessible, and engaging learning experiences.

- **Parents and caregivers**  
  Individuals who want visibility into learning progress and tools to support their child’s educational journey.

- **Special educators and support staff**  
  Teachers and therapists who require structured insights, flexible content delivery, and learner-specific customization options.
